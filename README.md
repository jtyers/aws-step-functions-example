# aws-step-functions-example

This is a complete AWS Step Functions example build using Terraform. It takes the first two tutorials in the AWS Step Functions documentation and deploys them using Terraform, with Lambda function code included in the repo as well. It's intended as a helpful starting point for new projects making use of Step Functions.

The [terraform-aws-lambda](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda) and [terraform-aws-step-functions](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-step-functions) modules are used to keep the code lean.
